To download specific folder you can use [SVN](https://subversion.apache.org/packages.html). 

For example, if you want download only folder `qt3d_ortho_vs_persp`, you must execute next command:

```bash
svn checkout https://github.com/troyane/StackOverflow-pro/trunk/qt3d_ortho_vs_persp
```
*You need just replace `tree/master` with `trunk` and you can get the specific folder.*
